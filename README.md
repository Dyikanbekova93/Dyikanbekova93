Description: Write a method called calculateStatistics() that takes an ArrayList of Integer objects as input. The method should calculate the average score, find the highest score, and find the lowest score from the list.

Params: An ArrayList of Integer objects.

Return: An array of three elements containing the average score (at index 0), highest score (at index 1), and lowest score (at index 2).

Example:

ArrayList<Integer> scores = [78, 92, 85, 64]

calculateStatistics(scores) //Return [79, 92, 64]

Note:

If the input ArrayList is empty, return an array of three elements with all values set to 0.
